# Doctor Visit Data Analysis
IBM SkillBuild Internship DA_Project

## Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis, summarization, and visualization of the "Doctor_visit" dataset. The dataset contains information about patients, including their gender, age, income, illness, and various other attributes collected during their visits to the hospital before going home. The goal is to gain valuable insights and identify patterns or trends related to the patients and their characteristics.

## Objectives

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of the data.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values or inconsistencies.
- Summarize key statistics and metrics for different attributes in the dataset.
- Visualize the data using various charts, graphs, and plots to uncover patterns and trends.
- Identify any correlations between different attributes and their impact on patient visits.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Features

- Utilizes Python programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- Utilizes popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Generates descriptive statistics, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
- Creates various types of visualizations, including bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, histograms, etc.
- Identifies outliers or anomalies in the data and explores their significance.
- Applies statistical tests or machine learning techniques for deeper analysis if required.
- Ensures clear documentation and code commenting for better understanding and collaboration.

## Installation
